        <p>Chicken in a pot. Ingredients: 500 g ripe tomatoes, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 onion, 200 g olives, ½ a bunch of  fresh flat-leaf parsley, 1 x 400 g tin chickpeas, 4 free-range chicken legs, olive oil, 1.5 litres  organic chicken stock, 1 fresh bay leaf, 200 g baby potatoes.<br> Method. Halve any large tomatoes, then peel and finely slice the garlic. Peel and chop the onion, stone the olives, and pick and roughly chop the parsley. Drain the chickpeas. In a large pan, brown the chicken in a little oil. Drain off any excess fat, then add the tomatoes, stock and garlic. Simmer for 45 minutes, then add all the other ingredients. Cook on a low heat for a further 30 minutes. Before serving, shred the chicken from the bone and add it back to the pan, discarding the bones and skin, then season to taste. Delicious served with garlic mayo and a chunk of crusty bread.<br><br>
        Spring chicken pie. Ingredients: 2 lemons, 500 g Jersey Royals, ½ a bunch of  fresh tarragon, 1 bunch of  fresh flat-leaf parsley, 8 free-range chicken thighs, bone in, skin on, from sustainable sources, 6 cloves of garlic, olive oil, 50  g unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons plain flour, 400 ml  chicken stock, 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, 75  g watercress, 5 sheets of filo pastry.<br>
        Method. Preheat the oven to 190ºC/gas 5. Halve the lemons, quarter the Jersey Royals, then pick and finely chop the tarragon and parsley. Put the chicken, unpeeled garlic cloves, lemon and potatoes in a large baking tray, drizzle with oil, season, then toss together and pop in the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden, crispy and cooked. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large non-stick saucepan until bubbling. Add the flour and stir for 1 to 2 minutes to form a paste, then slowly pour in the stock, whisking until thickened. Add the mustard, then season. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and reserve the skin and discard any gristle. Shred the meat, discarding the bones. Squeeze the garlic from its skins back into the roasting tray and squeeze over all the juice from the lemons and toss well. Pour over the thickened stock and add the herbs and watercress. Check the seasoning, then finely chop the chicken skins and sprinkle over the filling. Lay out sheets of filo on a clean surface and cut each one in half. Lightly scrunch up and place on top of the pie filling, brushing with the melted butter. Bake for 25 minutes, or until crispy and golden, then serve with a crisp green salad.<br><br>
        Roast chicken with potatoes and carrots. Ingredients: 500 g carrots, 600 g potatoes, 1 bulb of garlic, 5 sprigs of fresh rosemary, olive oil, 1 x 1.6 kg  whole free-range chicken, 1 lemon, 5 sprigs of fresh thyme.<br>
        Method. Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Scrub, trim and halve the carrots lengthways. Scrub, peel and halve the potatoes, quartering any larger ones. Add to a large roasting tray. Break the garlic bulb into cloves, leaving them unpeeled, then lightly crush with the flat side of a knife. Pick the rosemary leaves, discarding the stalks. Add the garlic and rosemary leaves to the tray. Drizzle with oil, season with sea salt and black pepper, then toss well and spread out in an even layer. Rub the chicken all over with a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of oil. Stuff the chicken cavity with the whole lemon and the thyme sprigs. Place the chicken in the tray, on top of the vegetables. Reduce the oven temperature to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6, then add the chicken and roast for 45 minutes. Carefully remove the tray from the oven, use tongs to turn the vegetables over, then spoon any juices from the tray over the chicken. Return the tray to the oven for a further 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. To check, pierce a chicken thigh with the tip of a sharp knife – if the juices run clear, it’s done. Otherwise return the tray to the oven, cook for a little while longer and repeat the test. Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a board and return the vegetables to the oven for a final 5 minutes to crisp up, if needed. Cover the chicken with a layer of tin foil and a tea towel, then leave to rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Using a sharp carving knife, carve up the chicken, then serve with the roasted veg. Delicious with a green salad on the side.<br><br>
        Southern Italian-style chicken. Ingredients: 4 small red onions, 1 bulb of fennel, olive oil, 1 teaspoon  chilli flakes, 1 tesapoon  fennel seeds, 1 pinch of  ground cinnamon, 1 pinch of  saffron, 4 free-range chicken thighs, 4 free-range drumsticks, 1 x 400 g tin of  plum tomatoes, 2 fresh tomatoes, 1 small handful of  black olives (stone in), 300 g couscous, a few sprigs of fresh coriander.<br>
        Method. Peel and finely slice the onions, then trim and finely slice the fennel. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan, add the onions and fennel, along with the chilli flakes, fennel seeds and cinnamon and cook slowly for 10 to 15 minutes, or until soft and sticky. Meanwhile, add the saffron to a small cup, top up with a little hot water and set aside – this will draw the flavour out of the strands and allow it to mix evenly in the pan when you add it. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on a high heat, add the chicken thighs and drumsticks and brown on all sides, adding them to the veg pan when golden. Pour in the saffron-infused water, followed by the tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Fill the empty tin with water, pour into the pan and mix together. Add the bay, finely slice and add the preserved lemons, roughly chop and add the fresh tomatoes and destone and tear in the olives. Season with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then leave to bubble away for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the chicken starts to fall off the bone and the sauce has thickened and reduced. Put the couscous into a bowl and just cover with boiling salted water, then pop a plate on top and leave to fluff up. Serve the chicken and couscous, scattered with picked coriander.
